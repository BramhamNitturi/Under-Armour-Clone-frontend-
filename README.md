# Under-Armour-Clone-frontend-
This project is a frontend clone of the Under Armour landing page, built using HTML and CSS. The objective of this project was to recreate a modern e-commerce brand interface while focusing on clean layout structure, visual hierarchy.

"This project was intentionally built for desktop view to focus on layout precision and UI styling."

The page replicates the core sections typically seen on the Under Armour website, including the navigation bar, hero promotional banner, featured product categories, product showcase sections, and footer. The layout emphasizes strong typography, bold imagery, and a performance-focused design style that aligns with the brand’s identity.

While building this project, I focused on maintaining proper spacing, alignment, and consistency throughout the design. I used Flexbox and CSS positioning techniques to structure the layout efficiently and ensure that the interface feels balanced and professional.

This project helped me better understand how real-world e-commerce websites are structured and how frontend design plays a crucial role in user experience and brand representation.

This clone is created purely for educational and portfolio purposes. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Under Armour.
